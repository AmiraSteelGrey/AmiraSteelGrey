<h3 style="color:Gray;">EnglishShortStory</h3>

<p style="color:Green;">There was a young boy who could not control his anger. He would say whatever came to his mind, even if it hurts people. His father asked him to hammer in a nail in the backyard fence whenever he got angry. In the beginning, he used up a lot of nails. But as time went by, he started using less. The father then asked him to start removing a nail each day; he didn’t get angry. When he removed all the nails, the father asked him to see the holes in the fence. He reminded him that the fence would never be the same. Likewise, the things he had said to people could never be erased..</p>

<p style="color:black;">A partridge could not find food near its home, so it travelled far away to some cornfields. It stayed there for a few days before returning home. Meanwhile, a rabbit had found the empty nest and made itself at home. When the partridge returned, they both fought over whose house it was. The other animals suggested going to a judge. They found a praying cat by the river and decided to ask for help. Seeing how the cat was praying, they trusted it. The cat heard them both out but asked them to come closer as he couldn’t hear well. When they got closer, the cat killed and ate them both..</p>
